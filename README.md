# statistical rethinking 
This repo is for documenting working through the Statistical Rethinking 2nd Edition book by Richard McElreath. I have linked to my github so that I can also get practice using git and making commits etc.

Each week me and a few colleague meet after we have read through each chapter to test out in-text code and work through the end of chapter questions and potentially some of the homework questions posted in Richard McElreath's 2023 Statistical Rethinking Course github repo (link: https://github.com/rmcelreath/stat_rethinking_20239)
