# statistical rethinking 
This repo is to document me working through the Statistical Rethinking 2nd Edition book by Richard McElreath. I have linked to my github so that I can get practice using git and making commits etc.

Each week a few colleagues and I meet to talk about the end of chapter problems from the chapter discussed the previous week as well as discuss the material and test out in-text code for chapter for the current week. Potential we/I will also work through some of the homework questions posted in Richard McElreath's 2023 Statistical Rethinking Course github repo (link: https://github.com/rmcelreath/stat_rethinking_20239)

There will be an R Markdown file for each chapter that will have in-text code from each chapter as well as my solutions to the end of chapter problems and potentially of the homework questions from the Statistical Rethinking 2023 Course mentioned above. Note: Each R Markdown file will not contain all of the in-text code from the respective Chapter but only the ones I wanted to test out and confirm my understanding on. The code may differ slightly from the in-text code in terms of different object names and additional comments. Occasionally, I written the code in a slightly different manner what was more intuitive to me.
